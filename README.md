# Incident Tracker

Incident Tracker is a centralized platform for monitoring, managing, and analyzing application errors and customer-reported incidents.

It enables real-time ingestion of error logs from external systems and provides a structured workflow for tracking, investigating, and resolving issues, improving system reliability and operational visibility.

---

## Overview

Modern applications often rely on multiple systems and integrations, making it difficult to track failures and maintain visibility over incidents.

Incident Tracker solves this by:

* Centralizing error logs from different sources
* Allowing teams to manage incidents in a structured way
* Providing historical data for analysis and reporting
* Enabling better communication between technical teams and stakeholders

---

## Architecture

The platform is built using a modular and scalable backend architecture:

```
External Systems (Laravel, APIs)
            ↓
      Incident Tracker API (NestJS)
            ↓
        Prisma ORM
            ↓
         MySQL Database
```

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend

* NestJS
* Prisma ORM
* MySQL
* DTO validation with class-validator

### Infrastructure

* Docker (local development)
* Cloud-ready architecture (AWS)

---

## Core Features

### Error Log Ingestion

* Receive error logs via API (`POST /error-logs`)
* Structured storage of logs with metadata
* Support for multiple sources (systems, services, integrations)

---

### Incident Management

* Register and manage incidents linked to system errors
* Track status (open, in progress, resolved)
* Associate logs, metadata, and contextual information

---

### Data Structuring

Each error log includes:

* Message
* Severity level
* Environment (production, staging, etc.)
* Source system
* Timestamp
* Structured metadata (JSON)

---

### Observability

* Centralized visibility of system failures
* Foundation for dashboards and reporting
* Historical tracking of incidents

---

## API Example

### Create Error Log

**POST** `/error-logs`

```json
{
  "message": "NFe rejeitada",
  "level": "WARNING",
  "environment": "production",
  "source": "attimo",
  "occurredAt": "2026-04-24T16:21:53.000Z",
  "metadata": {
    "cStat": "696",
    "xMotivo": "Rejeição exemplo"
  }
}
```

---

## Running Locally

### 1. Start services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Run migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 4. Start application

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Cloud Architecture

The system is designed for deployment in cloud environments using AWS:

* **EC2** → Application hosting
* **RDS** → Managed relational database
* **S3** → File storage (attachments, screenshots)
* **Lambda** → Background processing and scheduled tasks

---

## Use Cases

* Centralized error tracking for distributed systems
* Incident management for production environments
* Monitoring integrations with external services
* Supporting operational workflows for development teams

---

## Roadmap

* Dashboard with filters and metrics
* Customer ticket system
* File uploads and attachments
* Notifications and alerts
* Authentication and authorization
* Background job processing (queues)
* Full AWS deployment
